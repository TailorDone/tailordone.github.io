        <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p id = "Intro">I became infatuated with the Tech Scene while teaching High School Math in Seattle. As I discovered the world of Software Development the transition from teacher to tech proved to be a natural and logical process. I’ve always loved problem-solving, troubleshooting, and creating. My background in teaching has allowed me to gain the skills to think about and approach problems from multiple perspectives, be cognizant of where errors could occur along the way, and to be a continual learner and questioner. Coding truly has become a passion of mine and I am excited to be taking the steps towards becoming a Software Developer.

            I will graduate from the University of Utah with my Master of Software Development in December of 2021. I'm looking for a summer internship with a company that is collaborative and innovative, that is passionate about the work they produce, that is diverse and actively making the workplace better for all individuals, and who pushes employees to never stop learning. </p></div>
