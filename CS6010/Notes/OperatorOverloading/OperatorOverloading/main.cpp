    // cout << myFrac
    //Left of operator is this. so cout.opp<<(myFrac). This is an ostream class that we can't change.
    //std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& outs, const Frac& rhs){ Have to take it by reference
    // return outs}; Have to return by reference
    //((cout << f1) << f2)
    //in order for this to work, we need (cout<<f1) to give us a cout
    //[] method
    //Type MyVect::operator[](int index) const{ Type for our vector right now is an int. const means we won't change it, allows us to have 2 differen methods. one that changes a value, one that does not
    // return p[index];
    //cout<<mv[2]<<endl
    //mv[2] = 3; This won't work because you can't change your vector this way. it's give you a brand new int
    //But if we change the return type we can
    //Type& MyVect::operator[](int index){
    //return p[index];
    //} Actually modify what is on the heap. Need the bottom version to support mv[2]=3; But the bottom version sucks for printing
    // Because if you return the reference someone could modify it
    //op[] 2 versions with same body, 1 is const and returns a value, the other is not const, returns a reference
    //MyVec v(10;
    //Want to clear that heap by using v.freevector;
    //}the compiler knows that v's life has ended at this point. So we can have the compiler run some code when one of our objects is about to go out of scope. We want freevector to happen automatically
    //Destructor looks like a constructor, but it has been bitwise not ~className();
    //called automatically by compiler when a variable goes out of scope

    MyString s3=s2;//something went wrong here. looks like you are making a copy of s2, but what's happening is we are giving it the same pointer. This is called a shallow copy. Makes a duplicate pointer as opposed to a copy

//For <=>Project Settings, c++lanugage other dialect c++2a

// ahve to use new keyword to allocate new memory
