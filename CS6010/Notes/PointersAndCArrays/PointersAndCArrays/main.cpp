//To understand what is happening, we need to know pointers
//Pointer is an index into the giant list of bytes we call RAM
// int* p //is a pointer to an int. Pointer is an arrow. there is an int at the end of the arrow
//char* s//pointer
//this says s is a pointer to char
//what is actually stored is the address
//dereferencing means "follow the arrow"
//cout << *pi this means follow the arrow
//declaring is an arrow to something
//if i have an arrow or pointer, the star in front means follow the arrow
//we can use this to read or write
// *pi = 10;
//*pi = *pi + 1 (need the starts to follow the arrow every time)
//pi = pi + 1 makes the arrow point somewhere else
//c style swap

void swap (int *a, int *b){
//void swap (int a, int b){
    //int temp = a; mismatched type with an int and an int pointer
    int temp = *a; //follows the arrow to the integer at the end of a
    *a = *b;
    //a = b;
    //b = temp;
    *b = temp; //we want to change the value that b is pointing to to temp

        //square brackets means starting with the pointer at the front, go forward i slots
    }

//argc (arg count) is the lenght of the array. char * is string char ** is a pointer to string, array of string. argv (arg vector)
