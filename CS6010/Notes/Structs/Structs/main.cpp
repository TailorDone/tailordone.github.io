//in header files, x code adds #ifndef SOMEHTING #define SOMETHING --your code-- #endif
//these are called include guards

//main.cpp a.hpp b.hpp a.cpp b.cpp
//inside of b, you have struct B{}
//inside of a, you have int f(B b)
//you'll have a compiler error. you have to #include "b.hpp"
//Inside main we need a B b; so we need to #include "b.hpp"
// f(b) can't be called because we need a's header file #include "a.hpp"
// we can now get rid of the b.hpp becuase a will call that for us anyway.
// we only want it once or else it will copy twice
// include guards. if we've seen this file already, don't copy and paste it again
// alternatively  you'll see #pragma once //same things ad ifndef, define, endif
