    //Stack Memory
    //When calling a function, this allocates memory for all local variables
    //Returning from a function deallocates all the stack memory
    //automatic memory management. #1 choice if possible
    //Issues with the stack.
    //1) Limited size --- Huge data cant go in the stack
    //2) size is not known until runtime. stack fram size must be known at compile time. -- data size not known until runtime, it can't live on the stack.
    //3) stack memory is deallocated when the function returns -- if data needs to outlive the function call, it can't go in the stack
    // Other part of memory is called "the heap"
    // Explicity allocate and deallocate our heap memory
    //If it has a name,usually on the stack, otherwise the heap
    //allocate memory "new"
    //free memory "delete"
    int *pInt = new int; //returns a pointer to memory on the heap big enough to store an int
    pInt = new int[10]; //changed the pointer to the beginning of an array with 10 ints. The first int stays but nothing is pointing to it.
    double *dArr = new double[5]; //Returns a pointer to teh beginning of an array with 5 doubles
    delete pInt; //Says I am finished with what's on the other end of the pointer. it doesn't change the data, doesn't change pointer
    //makes space on heap to hold this data, returns a pointer to beginning of that memomry
    //memory leak is a new with no matching delete. wasted space
    //dangling pointer, pointer to memomry that I shouldn't access
    //use after free (dereference a pointer after deleting)
    //uninitialized pointer use

    *ip = 10; //probably crash
