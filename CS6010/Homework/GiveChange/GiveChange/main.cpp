//    Alternative Solution Not Using Mod
//    Replace line 22-26 with the following
//    remainderChange = remainderChange - quarters * 25;
//    dimes = remainderChange / 10;
//    remainderChange = remainderChange - dimes * 10;
//    nickels = remainderChange / 5;
//    remainderChange = remainderChange - nickels * 5;
//    pennies = remainderChange;
