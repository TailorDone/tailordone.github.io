//Write a function that takes an array of doubles as a parameter (well, as 2 parameters, a pointer to a double, and the size of the array) and returns a copy of the array (it should return a pointer to the start of the copied array). Test your copy function.
double* copyArray(double* arr, int size){
    double *newArr = new double[size];
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){

    }
    return newArr;
}


int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
//    int* y = f();
//    std::cout << y << std::endl;
    //The issue is we are returning the address of where x=5 is located on the stack, but once we leave the f() method that information will be removed from the stack, and so the int x=5 will no longer be stored there.
