            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a self-proclaimed nerd and proud! I've been a Mythic World of Warcraft raider, I'm (almost) level 40 in Pokémon Go, and I would play Secret Hitler/Wereworlf/Among Us for hours if given the chance. I grew up playing sports, but typically now if I'm doing something athletic it's either lifting at the gym, taking my schnauzers to the park, or playing some competive pickleball (yes, that's a thing, and yes, it's amazing!) I'm a die-hard Utah Ute and have spent the past 3 years volunteering for the University of Utah's Alumni Association Club for both Seattle and Salt Lake City. This included becoming the President of the Seattle Alumni Club before moving back to Utah. I love the Seattle Seahawks and will always pick Russell Wilson as my Fantasy Quarterback. I'm a musical enthusiast and have probably listened to the Hamilton soundtrack at least 50 times. I love to travel and always make sure to check out the local breweries of whatever city I'm visiting. I was voted "Most Friendly" by my fellow interns at Lucid which is a testiment to my outgoing personality. I genuinely like being around and meeting new people and I love working with and learning from others. I love being challenged and enjoy the satisfaction of solving a hard problem. I am a life-long learner and spend a lot of my freetime trying to become a better developer. A personal career goal of mine is to reach a management position as I love helping others learn and grow and teaching will always be a huge part of my personality. </p>
