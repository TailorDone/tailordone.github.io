        <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p id = "Intro">I became infatuated with the Tech Scene while teaching High School Math in Seattle, Washington. I began coding as an outlet to decompress from my stressful days of teaching. I'm happy to say that coding is a passion project of mine and I'm excited to mold it into a career. A move back home to Utah sparked the decision to make the switch from teaching to tech. I began studying a 2nd Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Utah in January of 2020. During this time, I was made aware of the Master's of Software Development Program for which I applied and was accepted. I will graduate from the University of Utah with my MSD in December of 2021. I’ve always loved problem-solving, creating, working with and learning from peers. I’m excited to take my skills to the next level in Software Development. </p></div>
