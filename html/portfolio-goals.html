        <div id="Interests">
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>I pride myself on being a self-proclaimed nerd. You'll frequently find my spouse and me at a restaurant with a deck of cards while we wait for our food or out playing Pokémon Go while we walk our miniature schnauzers. I try to be a daily gym goer but solely so that I can eat and drink what I want with a little less guilt. I'm a die-hard Utah Ute and have spent the past 3 years volunteering for the University of Utah's Alumni Association Club for both Seattle and Salt Lake City. This included becoming the President of the Seattle Alumni Club before moving back to Utah. I grew up playing sports and still enjoy a co-ed softball game here and there. I love the Seattle Seahawks and will always pick Russell Wilson as my Fantasy Quarterback when given the chance. I'm a musical enthusiast and have spent more money on West End than I care to admit. I love being challenged and enjoy the satisfaction of solving a hard problem. This originally led me to the challenge of teaching high schoolers to love math. Though I loved my time as a teacher, the booming tech industry has completely won me over and I am ecstatic to be switching to Software Development and the challenges it presents.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Goals">
            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>I'm passionate about my work and my projects, but I firmly believe in the importance of a work-life balance. I love the hustle and bustle of the city and I thrive around large groups of people. I would love a career that takes me to a major city such as New York, Seattle, San Francisco, or Amsterdam. Ultimately, I hope to find a software development job in a large city that will fulfill my passion of being challenged while also allowing me to spend time doing the things I love outside of work. I want to work on a passionate team of smart, dedicated, and down to earth people who work together to achieve a common goal. I would love to find myself in a leadership position down the road as teaching is still a passion of mine (once a teacher, always a teacher!) I would also love to continue to give back to the education system whether it be coaching a local high school team or helping with a coding or robotics club.</p>
