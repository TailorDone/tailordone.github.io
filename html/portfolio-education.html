            <h1>Educational Background</h1>
            <p>I received my BS in Mathematics teaching from the University of Utah in 2014. I then moved to Seattle, Washington, where I received a Master in Teaching from Seattle University in 2015. I taught High School Math in Seattle for 4 years before deciding to make a career change. I started studying a 2nd Bachelor's of Computer Science from the University of Utah in January 2020. I was then encouraged by my professor to apply for the Master in Software Development Program. I was accepted and started the program in August of 2020. I will graduate with my Master in Software Development in December of 2021.</p>
